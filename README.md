# HangTab

A simple MAUI app that records bowling 'hangings' and 'bus rides' for a team.

![save and display your team's hangings](images/01.png) ![celebrate a busride with your team](images/02.png) ![maintain your teammates easily](images/03.png) ![view past weeks in the season](images/04.png) ![dark mode relax your eyes](images/05.png)

**Notes:**
- A 'hanging' is when all bowlers BUT ONE strike, that bowler is then 'hung'.

- A 'bus ride' is when ALL bowlers strike in the same frame (no bowler is 'hung').
